# Style Guide
This is a style guide for cs 340 assignment 3. The items in this guide
are mostly copied from the Google open source C++ style guide. This is a
small subset of that guide.

Google states that "the goal of this guide is to manage this complexity 
by describing in detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++ code . These 
rules exist to keep the code base manageable while still allowing coders 
to use C++ language features productively."

The style guide targets the reader of the code more than the writer


1. files
In general, every .c or .cc file should have an associated .h file. 
There are some common exceptions, such as unit tests and small .c or .cc 
files containing just a main() function.
Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the readability, 
size and performance of your code. 


2. file protection
All header files should have #define guards to prevent multiple inclusion. 
The format of the symbol name should be <PROJECT>_<PATH>_<FILE>_H_. 

To guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path in a project's 
source tree. For example, the file foo/src/bar/baz.h in project foo should 
have the following guard: 

#ifndef CODE_REVIEW_UU_H 
#define CODE_REVIEW_UU_H
...
#endif  /* CODE_REVIEW_UU_H */ 


3. null
Use '\0' for null chars (and not the 0 literal). 


The next few items involve naming.
The most important consistency rules are those that govern naming. The style of a name immediately informs us what 
sort of thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us 
to search for the declaration of that entity. The pattern-matching engine in our brains relies a great deal on these 
naming rules. Naming rules are pretty arbitrary, but we feel that consistency is more important than individual 
preferences in this area, so regardless of whether you find them sensible or not, the rules are the rules. Note 
that certain universally-known abbreviations are OK, such as i for an iteration variable and T for a template parameter. 

4. file names 
Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores (_) or dashes (-).
Follow the convention that your project uses. If there is no consistent 
local pattern to follow, prefer "_". 

Examples of acceptable file names: 

    my_useful_class.c

    my-useful-class.c 

    myusefulclass.cc 

C++ files should end in .cc, C files should end in .c, and header files 
should end in .h. 


5. variable names
The names of variables (including function parameters) and data members are 
all lowercase, with underscores between words. 

Common Variable names 

For example: 

std::string table_name;  // OK - lowercase with underscore. 
std::string tableName;   // Bad - mixed case.  


6. Function Names 
Regular functions have mixed case; accessors and mutators may be named like variables. 

Ordinarily, functions should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. 

AddTableEntry()
DeleteUrl()
OpenFileOrDie()  


7. macro names 
Macro names should be named with all capitals and underscores. 

#define ROUND(x)
#define PI_ROUNDED 3. 


8. Comments
Comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code readable. The following rules describe what you should 
comment and where. But remember: while comments are very important, the best code is self-documenting. 
Giving sensible names to types and variables is much better than using obscure names that you must then 
explain through comments. 

When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next contributor who will need to understand 
your code. Be generous, the next one may be you! 

Comment Style 

Use either the // or /* */ syntax, as long as you are consistent. 

You can use either the // or the /* */ syntax; 
Be consistent with how you comment and what style you use where. 

Multi-line comments look like one of the following:

/* 
 * Multi-line comments look like this.  Make them real sentences. 
 * Fill them so they look like real paragraphs.
 */

// 
// Multi-line comments look like this.  Make them real sentences. 
// Fill them so they look like real paragraphs.
//
 

Single line comments may be any of the following:

/* 
 * VERY important single-line comments look like this. 
 */

//
// or like this
//

/* Most single-line comments look like this. */

// or like this


9. Comments at the start of functions
Function declarations should have comments immediately preceding 
it that describe what the function does and how to use it.

/* 
 * All major routines should have a comment briefly describing what 
 * they do.  The comment before the "main" routine should describe 
 * what the program does. The comment should use the format of
 * multi-line or VERY important comment shown above.
 */
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
}


10. Grammar
Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read well-written comments 
than badly written ones. 

Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalization and punctuation. 
In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence fragments. Shorter comments, 
such as comments at the end of a line of code, can sometimes be less formal, but you should be 
consistent with your style. 

Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are using a comma 
when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that source code maintain a high 
level of clarity and readability. Proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal. 


11. Formatting 
Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a project is much easier to follow if everyone 
uses the same style. Individuals may not agree with every aspect of the formatting rules, and some of 
the rules may take some getting used to, but it is important that all project contributors follow the 
style rules so that they can all read and understand everyone's code easily. 

Line Length:
Each line of text in your code should be at most 80 characters long. 

We recognize that this rule is controversial, but so much existing code already adheres to it, 
and we feel that consistency is important. 

Those who favor this rule argue that it is rude to force them to resize their windows and there is 
no need for anything longer. Some folks are used to having several code windows side-by-side, and 
thus don't have room to widen their windows in any case. People set up their work environment assuming 
a particular maximum window width, and 80 columns has been the traditional standard. Why change it? 

Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make code more readable. The 80-column limit is an 
hidebound throwback to 1960s mainframes; modern equipment has wide screens that can easily show longer lines. 

80 characters is the maximum. 

 
12. Spaces vs. Tabs 
Use only spaces, and indent 4 spaces at a time. 

We use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your editor to emit 
spaces when you hit the tab key. 


13. function declarations 

Return type on the line before the function name. Parameters on the same line 
as the function name if they fit. Wrap parameter lists which do not fit on 
a single line as you would wrap arguments in a function call. 

Functions look like this: 

ReturnType 
FunctionName(Type par_name1, Type par_name2) 
{  
    DoSomething();
    ...
}  

If you have too much text to fit on one line: 

ReturnType 
ReallyLongFunctionName(Type par_name1, Type par_name2, 
                       Type par_name3) {  
    DoSomething();
    ...
} 


14. Conditionals 
In an if statement, including its optional else if and else clauses, put one 
space between the if and the opening parenthesis, and between the closing 
parenthesis and the curly brace (if any), but no spaces between the 
parentheses and the condition or initializer. If the optional initializer 
is present, put a space or newline after the semicolon, but not before. 

if(condition) {      // Bad - space missing after IF
if ( condition ) {   // Bad - space between the parentheses and the condition
if (condition){      // Bad - space missing before {
if(condition){       // Doubly bad

if (int a = f();a == 10) {   // Bad - space missing after the semicolon  

Use curly braces for the controlled statements following if, else if and else.
Break the line immediately after the opening brace, and immediately before 
the closing brace. A subsequent else, if any, appears on the same line as the 
preceding closing brace, separated by a space. 


if (condition) {   // no spaces inside parentheses, space before brace
    DoOneThing();    // four space indent
    DoAnotherThing();
} else if (int a = f(); a != 3) {  // closing brace on new line, else on same line
    DoAThirdThing(a);
} else {
    DoNothing();
}


15. Switch Statements 
Switch statements may use braces for blocks. Case blocks in switch statements can have curly 
braces or not, depending on 
your preference.

If not conditional on an enumerated value, switch statements should always 
have a default case (in the case of an enumerated value, the compiler will 
warn you if any values are not handled). If the default case should never 
execute, treat this as an error. Indentation should be as follows:  

switch (var) {
    case 0:  // 4 space indent
        ...  // 8 space indent
        break;
    case 1:
        ...
        break;
    default:
        assert(false);
}


16. single-statement loops. 
Braces are required for single-statement loops.

for (int i = 0; i < kSomeNumber; ++i)  // WRONG
  printf("I love you\n");

for (int i = 0; i < kSomeNumber; ++i) {  // RIGHT
  printf("I take it back\n");
}


17. Return Values 
Do not needlessly surround the return expression with parentheses. 

Use parentheses in return expr; only where you would use them in x = expr;. 

return result;   // No parentheses in the simple case.
// Parentheses OK to make a complex expression more readable.
return (some_long_condition &&
        another_condition);

return (value);                // You wouldn't write var = (value);
return(result); 


18. Function prototypes 
Function prototypes for private functions (i.e., functions not used elsewhere) 
go at the top of the first source module. In the kernel, private functions 
do not require a prototype as long as they are defined before they are used. 
In userspace, functions local to one source module should be declared 'static'.
 This should not be done in the kernel since it makes it impossible to use 
the kernel debugger. 

Functions used from other files are prototyped in the relevant include file. 

Functions that are used locally in more than one module go into a separate 
header file

Prototypes should not have variable names associated with the types; i.e., 

voidfunction(int);  

not:  

voidfunction(int a); 


19. unsigned ints 
When defining unsigned integers use 'unsigned int' rather than 
just 'unsigned'; the latter has been a source of confusion in the past. 

 
20. Exit code
Exits should be 0 on success, or non-zero for errors. 

/* 
 * Avoid obvious comments such as 
 * "Exit 0 on success." 
 */
exit(0); 

 
21. Register
Use of the 'register' specifier is discouraged in new code. Optimizing 
compilers such as gcc can generally do a better job of choosing which 
variables to place in registers to improve code performance.
